# animations

An application to have an overview of different css animations I made, in the future it's the plan to add some shareable code, to simply implement it into your code!

## Requirements
For this code `node` and `npm` should be installed.

## Running the code
Before the code can be run, you need to install the node packages with `npm i`.
After this you can simply run the code by running `npm run start`, open your browser on `localhost:8080` and you should see the application.
